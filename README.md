Comp Graphic and Visualization

**How do I approach designing software?**
Before this course, I had yet to work on the design phase of a project. I learned a lot of skills with designing using OpenGL and the different libraries associated with the project. The design process that I followed was incremental additions and improvements to the overall design week by week. These increments included slowly adding in the different objects, adding in textures, and finally adding in lighting to the scene. This same iteritive process can be applied to future work, whether it be in another class or professionally. 

**How do I approach developing programs?**
Similar to how I approach designing software, iterational changes to the design are important when developing complex programs such as 3D scenes. When working on the scene, I did a lot of trial and error with placing objects, adding textures, and placing the ligting. I would make a small change and then run the program to see how it affected the scene. Sometimes I would have to change something a few times and run the program in order to finally get the object in the right place or the light in the right spot. I also became more familiar with the code and how each method affected the scene. At first, the program seemed very big and complex, but by the end of week 7, I had a much better understanding of how each worked and how I could change something in each one to get the effect that I wanted.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computational graphics and visualization are a big part of my future educational pathway. For example, I am taking a couple of game design and graphics courses soon, and all of the skills that I learned with creating and manipulating a 3D scene are sure to be very usefull in those courses. I would also like to develop my own apps and games in the future, and I would need to create 3D elements for these.
